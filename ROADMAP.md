- [ ] Zero critical security vulnerabilities
- [ ] Production environment stable

## Risk Mitigation

### High-Risk Items
1. **Service Integration Complexity**
   - Mitigation: Daily integration testing
   - Fallback: Monolithic approach if needed

2. **AI/ML Model Integration**
   - Mitigation: Start with simple algorithms
   - Fallback: Rule-based ranking system

3. **Infrastructure Complexity**
   - Mitigation: Use managed services where possible
   - Fallback: Simplified deployment on EC2

### Daily Checkpoints
- Morning standup (9 AM)
- Afternoon sync (2 PM)
- End-of-day demo (5 PM)

## Post-MVP Roadmap (Days 15-30)

### Week 3: Enhancement & Scale
- Advanced AI/ML features
- Performance optimization
- Additional data sources
- Mobile app development

### Week 4: Growth & Analytics
- User analytics dashboard
- A/B testing platform
- Advanced personalization
- API for third-party integrations

## Team Communication

- **Daily Updates**: Slack #orbit-agents channel
- **Blockers**: Escalate immediately to team lead
- **Demos**: Daily 5 PM team showcase
- **Retrospectives**: End of each week

**Sprint Master**: [Assign Team Lead]  
**Last Updated**: Day 1  
**Next Review**: Day 7  

> ðŸ’¡ **Remember**: This is an aggressive timeline. Quality over speed when trade-offs are necessary. We can always extend features post-MVP, but we need a solid foundation first.
