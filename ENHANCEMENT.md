Below is a pragmatic “level-up” guide: first, how to turn the 14-day MVP into something ~100× more compelling while staying near-zero-cost; then a blueprint for a 1 000×-better AI browser agent that you can iterate toward.

⸻

1 — Super-charging the existing roadmap (≈100 × uplift)

Area	What to change	Why it matters	Still free?
Agent Framework	Swap raw Playwright calls for AutoGen’s MultimodalWebSurfer + LangGraph for orchestration.	Gives you planning/reflect-retry loops, parallel sub-agents, and memory without you writing that plumbing.  ￼ ￼ ￼	Yes — both MIT/Apache 2.0.
Inference	Run quantised Mixtral 8×22B & Phi-3-mini locally via Ollama, fall back to Cloudflare Workers AI when you need GPU or a larger model.	Keeps dev laptops/offline demos blazing fast but still lets you spike to GPUs on demand.  ￼ ￼ ￼	Ollama = free; Workers AI gives 10 k neurons/day gratis.
State / Memory	Persist agent scratch-pads & user context in Cloudflare Durable Objects (free tier) instead of Redis unless you really need pub/sub.	Zero-latency KV + per-object SQLite; perfect for “memory-per-tab/agent”.  ￼	Free.
Edge Caching	Put all LLM calls behind Cloudflare AI Gateway (free) for automatic caching & rate-limit analytics.	Cuts token costs ~40 % in tests.  ￼	Free.
Observability	Replace Prometheus + Grafana mixture with OpenTelemetry + Grafana Cloud free tier → one line to instrument Python/JS.	Less infra to babysit; richer tracing.	Free.
Testing	Add Playwright’s codegen + AutoGen self-eval to create replayable E2E tests daily.	Tight feedback loop; stops silent breaks.	Free.
Timeline	Re-order days 1-5 to deliver a vertical slice: Auth → WebSurfer agent on a single site → Dashboard → Deploy to Workers.	Lets stakeholders see value by Day 5; everything else becomes additive.	—

2 — Re-scoped 14-day sprint (keeps same effort, hits higher ceiling)

Day 1-3 – Vertical Slice
	1.	Repo, CI, basic auth (as you have).
	2.	Deploy Workers project locally → Cloudflare Pages (free).
	3.	Prototype: ask → agent plans → WebSurfer opens bbc.com → extracts headline.

Day 4-5 – Edgeification
	•	Move inference to Ollama (local) + optional Workers AI remote call.
	•	Persist user & agent state in Durable Objects.
	•	Add AI Gateway caching in front of all LLM calls.

Day 6-9 – UX & Reliability
	•	LangGraph workflow builder UI (React + GraphQL).
	•	Live session viewer (WebSocket).
	•	Playwright-recorded test suite, run on every push.
	•	OpenTelemetry + Grafana Cloud dashboards.

Day 10-14 – Power Features
	•	Multi-site orchestration (AutoGen parallel agents).
	•	Smart form-filling with few-shot examples in prompt.
	•	Simple RAG: store scraped text in Chroma → ask model before re-crawling.
	•	Hardening: rate-limit, JWT rotation, Snyk OSS scan.

3 — Blueprint for a 1 000× stronger AI browser agent

Think “Jarvis for the web”: self-planning, vision-capable, policy-aware, continuously learning.

3.1  High-level architecture

┌──────── UI (React) ────────┐
│ Natural-lang prompt        │
└────┬────────┬──────────────┘
     │        │
     │   Event stream (WS)
     ▼        ▼
Planner LLM (Mixtral) ──► LangGraph DAG ──► Tool nodes
     ▲                         │
     │ Reflection              ▼
Memory (Durable Object + Chroma)     WebSurfer (Playwright headless)

3.2  Key capabilities & how to keep them free

Capability	Implementation tip	Cost control
Vision (detect buttons, captchas)	Feed Playwright screenshots to Workers AI CLIP to locate elements, fallback to heuristic DOM search.	First 10 k inferences/day free.
Self-heal	On selector failure, Agent asks Memory for last working selector → retries; else vision search.	Logic only.
Long-term memory	Vector store in open-source LanceDB on disk or R2; sync hot subset to Durable Objects.	Both free tiers.
Policy guardrails	Add “policy” node in LangGraph; run content through Claude or Mixtral with a blocking prompt.	Cheap tokens; can cache.
Offline mode	If no net/GPU, run quantised Phi-3-mini (4 GB) via GGUF on CPU.	Free.
Skill marketplace	Embed YAML manifests → load as LangGraph subgraphs (no code).	OSS.
Continuous learning	Nightly fine-tune Mixtral with differential feedback using Axolotl on cheap TPU-Research Cloud or Paperspace FREE GPU (time-boxed).	Free hours.

4 — Checklist to start tomorrow morning
	1.	Install AutoGen & LangGraph: pip install autogen langgraph playwright.
	2.	Spin up Workers project: npm create cloudflare@latest orbit-agents.
	3.	Add Ollama model: ollama pull mixtral:8x22b then OLLAMA_BASE=http://localhost:11434.
	4.	Hello-world plan-execute: small LangGraph DAG → WebSurfer visits example.com.
	5.	Push to GitHub → Workers CI (Pages deploy on PR).
	6.	Instrument OpenTelemetry (opentelemetry-instrument app.py) → Grafana Cloud.
	7.	Write first E2E test: Playwright record + npx playwright test.

If you complete the above in two days, you’ll already demonstrate an edge-deployed, self-planning browser agent with memory, observability, and zero monthly bill.

⸻

TL;DR
	•	Replace home-grown plumbing with AutoGen + LangGraph to unlock advanced planning & reflection for free.
	•	Offload GPU work to Ollama locally and Cloudflare Workers AI remotely to stay <$0.
	•	Use Durable Objects + AI Gateway for state & caching at the edge.
	•	Deliver a vertical slice in Day 1-5, then iterate.
	•	Layer vision, memory, and policy guardrails to achieve the “1 000×-better” agent without touching your wallet.
